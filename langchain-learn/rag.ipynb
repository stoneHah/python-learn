      "1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This is a prompting technique where the model is encouraged to \"think step by step\" to enhance its performance on complex tasks. By decomposing a big task into smaller steps, the agent can utilize more computational resources during testing and provide clearer interpretations of its thought process.\n",

      "2. **Tree of Thoughts**: An extension of CoT that explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It decomposes a problem into various thought steps and generates multiple thoughts for each step, forming a tree structure.
